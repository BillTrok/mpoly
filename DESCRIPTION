Description: mpoly allows for the symbolic manipulation of multivariate
    polynomials in a general and consistent way designed especially for
    sparse and super sparse polynomials.  It also allows for basic
    differential calculus with multivariate polynomials and Grobner basis
    calculations from computational algebraic geometry.
