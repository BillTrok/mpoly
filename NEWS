Version 0.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* a new function called plug allows users to plug values into indeterminates in mpoly objects.
* a new function called chebyshev allows users to compute chebyshev polynomials.  to do this (more) efficiently, memoisation is used.

CHANGES

* the internals of tuples have been changed, but the user shouldn't expect to see them.


FIXES 

* a bug in mp functions where non-parenthetical exponents in parenthetical expressions were mis-parsed has been fixed.


Version 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* is.linear function.
* round now has a method applicable to mpoly objects that rounds the coefficients.  this is particularly nice in combination with as.mpoly.lm.
* hard braces are now allowed for variables, e.g. x[1,1]

CHANGES

* vastly enhanced mp parser based on stringr 9.0.0 (now dependent on stringi).
* tests added.
* description file updated for CRAN's standards.



Version 0.0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* parenthetical expressions are now handled.

CHANGES

* permutations now returns a better ordered listing of the permutations of a set.  It also allows for the more flexible specification of (e.g.) permutations(5) for permutations(1:5).

FIXES

* some negative parsing in mp has been fixed.



Version 0.0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* division symbols in mp now return an error.
* mpoly now has a GPL-2 license.

FIXES

* fixed a glitch in print.mpoly that made mp("-1 + y") print as "-1 1  +  y".
* mpolyList now works on single elements, either a mpoly object (converting it to a mpolyList) or a call to mp.
* mp now properly handles constants raised to powers.


Version 0.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES

* Fixed an issue with as.mpoly (and is.mpoly.lm).



Version 0.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* as.mpoly method now defined for lm objects which makes an mpoly object out of a linear model.



Version 0.0.1
